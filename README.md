# Whiteboard-Application
This is a Java Swing project for a Whiteboard implementation

## Inspiration
It mimics the approach made by the Windows application called *Paint* using Java Swing in order to replicate some of the main functionalities and features of the real application.

## Features
The application multiple useful facilities:
- loading and displaying images 
- color configuration by defining the R, G, B and transparency components
- line style configuration (solid, dotted, dashed) and thickness settings (measured in pixels)
- freehand mouse drawing
- predefined forms drawing (mouse drag)
- text drawing (by selecting the font and the character size) with word-wrap if the image limits are reached
- simple image processing operations (greyscale conversion, computing the negative image, color components threshold filtering (considering the R, G, B limits))
- cropping image areas and saving them as a distinct images
- saving the image that reflects the the work area

## Final Thoughts and Disclaimer
The simplicity of the project is due to the low level of knowledge regarding Java in general at the time of building the project, but it still serves the purpose.
